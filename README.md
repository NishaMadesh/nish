THE SEVERITY PREDICTION OF THE BINARY AND MULTI-CLASS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE − A MACHINE LEARNING-BASED FUSION APPROACH

&quot;The severity prediction of the binary and multi-class cardiovascular disease − A machine
learning-based fusion approach&quot; is a research paper that proposes a novel approach for
predicting the severity of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using a fusion of different types of
data and machine learning algorithms.
The paper begins by highlighting the significance of CVD as a leading cause of death
globally and the need for accurate and reliable methods for predicting its severity. The
authors emphasize that predicting CVD severity is a challenging task due to the complex
relationships between different risk factors and the need for integrating multiple types of data
sources.
The proposed approach addresses these challenges by using a machine learning-based fusion
approach to combine demographic, clinical, and laboratory data to predict the severity of
CVD. The paper explains the concept of data fusion and its applications in CVD severity
prediction, highlighting its potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of prediction
models.
The concept of data fusion is explained, and the potential benefits of this approach are
highlighted, including improved accuracy and the ability to identify hidden patterns and
relationships in the data. The authors also explain that the proposed approach is a significant
departure from traditional approaches that rely on individual risk factors or isolated data
sources.
A comprehensive review of related work is provided, highlighting the limitations of previous
approaches and the need for a more integrated and accurate approach to predicting CVD
severity. The authors also discuss the different types of data sources and machine learning
algorithms used in previous studies, providing a clear context for the proposed approach.
The authors then provide a comprehensive review of related work on CVD severity
prediction, discussing the different types of data and machine learning algorithms used in
previous studies. They also highlight the limitations of previous approaches and explain how
the proposed fusion approach can address some of these limitations.
